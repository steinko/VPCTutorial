/**
 * <p> Creates a new Amazon Web Services secret access key and corresponding Amazon Web Services access key ID for the
 *             specified user. The default status for new keys is <code>Active</code>.</p>
 *         <p>If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on
 *             the Amazon Web Services access key ID signing the request. This operation works for access keys under
 *             the Amazon Web Services account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage Amazon Web Services account root
 *             user credentials. This is true even if the Amazon Web Services account has no associated users.</p>
 *         <p> For information about quotas on the number of keys you can create, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html">IAM and STS
 *                 quotas</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
 *         <important>
 *             <p>To ensure the security of your Amazon Web Services account, the secret access key is accessible
 *                 only during key and user creation. You must save the key (for example, in a text
 *                 file) if you want to be able to access it again. If a secret key is lost, you can
 *                 delete the access keys for the associated user and then create new keys.</p>
 *         </important>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { IAMClient, CreateAccessKeyCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-iam"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { IAMClient, CreateAccessKeyCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-iam"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new IAMClient(config);
 * const command = new CreateAccessKeyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link CreateAccessKeyCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link CreateAccessKeyCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link IAMClientResolvedConfig | config} for IAMClient's `config` shape.
