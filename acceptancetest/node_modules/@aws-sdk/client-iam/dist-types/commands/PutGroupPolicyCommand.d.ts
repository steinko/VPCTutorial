/**
 * <p>Adds or updates an inline policy document that is embedded in the specified IAM

 *         <p>A user can also have managed policies attached to it. To attach a managed policy to a
 *             group, use <a>AttachGroupPolicy</a>. To create a new managed policy, use
 *                 <a>CreatePolicy</a>. For information about policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/policies-managed-vs-inline.html">Managed
 *                 policies and inline policies</a> in the
 *             <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
 *         <p>For information about the maximum number of inline policies that you can embed in a
 *             group, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_iam-quotas.html">IAM and STS quotas</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p>
 *         <note>
 *             <p>Because policy documents can be large, you should use POST rather than GET when
 *                 calling <code>PutGroupPolicy</code>. For general information about using the Query
 *                 API with IAM, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAM_UsingQueryAPI.html">Making query requests</a> in the

 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { IAMClient, PutGroupPolicyCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-iam"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { IAMClient, PutGroupPolicyCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-iam"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new IAMClient(config);
 * const command = new PutGroupPolicyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link PutGroupPolicyCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link PutGroupPolicyCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link IAMClientResolvedConfig | config} for IAMClient's `config` shape.
