/**
 * <p>Deletes a signing certificate associated with the specified IAM user.</p>
 *         <p>If you do not specify a user name, IAM determines the user name implicitly based on
 *             the Amazon Web Services access key ID signing the request. This operation works for access keys under
 *             the Amazon Web Services account. Consequently, you can use this operation to manage Amazon Web Services account root
 *             user credentials even if the Amazon Web Services account has no associated IAM users.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { IAMClient, DeleteSigningCertificateCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-iam"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { IAMClient, DeleteSigningCertificateCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-iam"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new IAMClient(config);
 * const command = new DeleteSigningCertificateCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteSigningCertificateCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteSigningCertificateCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link IAMClientResolvedConfig | config} for IAMClient's `config` shape.
