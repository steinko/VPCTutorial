/**
 * <p>Creates a VPC endpoint for a specified service. An endpoint enables you to create a
 *             private connection between your VPC and the service. The service may be provided by Amazon Web Services,
 *             an Amazon Web Services Marketplace Partner, or another Amazon Web Services account. For more information,
 *             see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-endpoints.html">VPC Endpoints</a> in the
 *             <i>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud User Guide</i>.</p>
 *         <p>A <code>gateway</code> endpoint serves as a target for a route in your route table for
 *             traffic destined for the Amazon Web Service. You can specify an endpoint policy to attach
 *             to the endpoint, which will control access to the service from your VPC. You can also
 *             specify the VPC route tables that use the endpoint.</p>
 *         <p>An <code>interface</code> endpoint is a network interface in your subnet that
 *             serves as an endpoint for communicating with the specified service. You can specify the
 *             subnets in which to create an endpoint, and the security groups to associate with the
 *             endpoint network interface.</p>
 *         <p>A <code>GatewayLoadBalancer</code> endpoint is a network interface in your subnet that serves an endpoint for communicating with a Gateway Load Balancer that you've configured as a VPC endpoint service.</p>
 *         <p>Use <a>DescribeVpcEndpointServices</a> to get a list of supported
 *             services.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.

 * import { EC2Client, CreateVpcEndpointCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-ec2"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { EC2Client, CreateVpcEndpointCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-ec2"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new EC2Client(config);
 * const command = new CreateVpcEndpointCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link CreateVpcEndpointCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link CreateVpcEndpointCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link EC2ClientResolvedConfig | config} for EC2Client's `config` shape.
